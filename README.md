dotfiles
========

My public dotfiles, that I install on all machines I use.

These dotfiles are meant to be installed using [dotlink][] to create symlinks
or copy the dotfiles into the correct locations.  Modify `.dotfiles` if you
wish to install just a subset of the dotfiles, or just copy/symlink them one
at a time.


setup
-----

To install all the dotfiles at once using dotlink directly from github:

    $ dotlink git://github.com/jreese/dotfiles

Note that dotlink will overwrite any existing dotfiles.
